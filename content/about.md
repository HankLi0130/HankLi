Hello there, my name is Hank, I come frome Taiwan. I'm an Android Developer. I love coding, traveling and sharing. And I would like to be your friend no matter where you come from. You can ask me all the questions about Taiwan, Android, Kotlin or everything you want to know. Feel free to contact me!

I'm seeking an opportunity to move to Canada to live and work. I'd been to Toronto for a year and I love Canada. I love the weather, culture and people in Canada, especially,the people live there are so nice and friendly. I remember there was a man told a waman who he doesn't know that her wallet was dropped down and he picked it up and gave it to that woman. That was so sweet and nice. You can see the people always remind you that your backpack is open even you don't know that person. And the weather is chilly and cool, it's prefect for coding computer, ha, I guess.
