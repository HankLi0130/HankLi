I'm seeking an opportunity to move to Canada to live and work. I'd been to Toronto for a year and I love it. I love the weather, culture and people in Canada. The weather usually is chilly and cool, it's prefect for coding. In winter, I can enjoy snowboarding, it's not gonna happen in Taiwan because it's too hot in Taiwan even in the winter. I like speaking English environment, it makes me feel good, especially in coding, it just like I'm talking to my computer, that's really amazing. And the best part of the Canada is the people, they are so nice and friendly. I remember there was a man told a waman who he doesn't know that her wallet was dropped down and he picked it up and returned it. That was so sweet. You can see the people always remind you that your backpack is open even you don't know that person. Canadians are awesome!
